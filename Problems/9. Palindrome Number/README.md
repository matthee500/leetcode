# Palindrome Checker
This script contains a class `Solution` with a method `isPalindrome` that takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer is a palindrome or not.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Usage
To use this script, create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isPalindrome` method on the instance with an integer as an argument. The method will return `True` if the integer is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
