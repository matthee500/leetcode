# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

This Python script defines a `Solution` class with a `removeDuplicates` method that takes a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and removes any duplicate values from the list in place. The method returns the number of unique elements in the list.

## Usage
The script includes a `main()` function that demonstrates how to use the `Solution` class and its `removeDuplicates()` method. You can run this function to see an example of how the script works:

This will print the number of unique elements and the modified list for an example input.
