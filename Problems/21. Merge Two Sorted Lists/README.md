# Merge Two Lists
This program merges two sorted linked lists and returns it as a new sorted list. The new list is made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Usage
To use this program, you need to define two lists that you want to merge. Then, create linked lists from these regular lists using the `create_linked_list` function. Finally, create an instance of the `Solution` class and call its `mergeTwoLists` method to merge and sort the two linked lists.

## Installation
