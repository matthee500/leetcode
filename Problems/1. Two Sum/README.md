# Two Sum

This program contains a class `Solution` with a method `twoSum` that takes in a list of integers (`nums`) and a target integer (`target`) as input. The method returns a list of two indices of the numbers in `nums` that add up to `target`.

## Usage

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. The program will output the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target value.

## Example

As an example, the user entered an array with 4 elements: `[2, 7, 11, 15]`. The target value is `9`. The program outputs `[0, 1]` because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`.
