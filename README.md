## Introduction
This repository contains my Python solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is an online platform that provides a collection of algorithmic challenges and interview questions for programmers who want to practice and improve their coding skills. The problems range from easy to hard, and cover various topics such as arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey and share my solutions with other learners who might find them helpful or inspiring. I try to write clean, concise and well-commented code that follows the Python style guide (PEP 8). I also include some explanations and analysis of the algorithms and data structures I use, as well as the time and space complexity of each solution.

## Structure
Each problem has its own folder that contains the Python file with a README file with the problem description and link. You can browse the repository using the table of contents below, or use the search function to find a specific problem by name or number.

## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy exploring this repository and find it useful for your own learning. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions, feel free to contact me or open an issue. Happy coding!
